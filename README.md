## 📚 Challenges & Strategy

### Privacy vs Convenience
Part of the struggle when developing software that uses personal information is balancing user privacy and convenience. From the beginning, I prioritized protecting user data, especially since nutrition tracking often involves sensitive health-related information.

One of the first steps was ensuring that data stored in the backend was handled securely. I used Spring Boot with JPA (Java Persistence API) to manage database interactions, which allowed for structured, secure, and efficient data access.

Another key consideration was how to protect user accounts without creating unnecessary friction. Requiring users to log in every time they opened the app would be secure but frustrating. To strike a balance, I implemented an authentication system using access and refresh tokens. This approach allowed users to remain logged in for a set period while ensuring that sensitive endpoints were still protected by time-limited access tokens. If an access token expired, the app could securely request a new one using the refresh token — reducing friction without compromising security.

I also made a conscious decision to limit the amount of personal information collected. Outside of food and nutrition data, only a user’s name, email, address, and password are stored. Additional health metrics such as height, weight, age, and pregnancy status are used solely for the purpose of calculating personalized nutritional goals — they are processed in-memory and never saved to the database. This approach helped reduce the app’s data privacy footprint while still delivering a personalized experience.

### Finding Quality Data

Accurate data is foundational to the credibility of any health or nutrition-related application. One of the earliest challenges I faced was ensuring that the nutritional goals generated by the app were both consistent and scientifically grounded. To achieve this, I sourced all recommended daily intake values from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Using a trusted and evidence-based source helped ensure that user recommendations aligned with current dietary guidelines.

Finding a reliable food database presented a separate challenge. Many publicly available datasets lacked completeness, consistency, or came from unknown sources. After evaluating several options, I chose the USDA FoodData Central database. Maintained by a reputable government agency, it offers a comprehensive and well-documented dataset of foods, nutrients, and branded products. This choice gave me confidence in the accuracy of food entries while also improving the transparency and traceability of the data used in the app.
